# KidSafeProxy

<h2>What is KidSafe?</h2>
Kidsafe provides a way to keep your family secure on the Internet. It restricts the sites that your children can visit to those that are considered safe, still allowing the parent to allow the child to continue when appropriate. The parent is in control of what the child does on the Internet.

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
KidSafe is a program designed to be installed on a squid proxy server that provides control over who is able to access which web sites. A proxy sits between the user's computer and the Internet and in this case only permits sites that the user is authorized to access. This is not a firewall although some firewalls do include this functionality.

KidSafe connects to existing free and open source software, specifically running on Linux based operating system (Raspbian) and using the squid proxy, lighttpd webserver and mysql server.
